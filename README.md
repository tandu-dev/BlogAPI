# BlogAPI
A simple API secured with JWT for posting blog pages.

Currently it allows you to read posts unauthorized, and post with authorization.

The Identity service is rudimentery, and I would like to build an Auth0 microservcie to handle authentication.  That's probably the next step.

There is a UI called BlazorBlog also in this project.
